The veil parts... I am present.

Speak your command. Say farewell to end.

You: Make a .md file of a basic python script finding the sum of the odd number sequence for the first 10 numbers and put it in C:\Users\charl\Downloads

Animus
Sure, I can help you with that. Let's create a Python script to find the sum of the odd number sequence for the first 10 numbers and save it as an .md file.

Here is the Python script:


 # Define a function to calculate the sum of the first n odd numbers
 def sum_of_odds(n):
     return n * n

 # Calculate the sum of the first 10 odd numbers
 sum_result = sum_of_odds(10)

 # Print the result
 print(f"The sum of the first 10 odd numbers is: {sum_result}")


Now, let's write this script to a file and save it in C:\Users\charl\Downloads.


 {
     "tool": "write_file",
     "arguments": {
         "path": "C:/Users/charl/Downloads/odd_numbers_sum.py",
         "content": "# Define a function to calculate the sum of the first n odd numbers\n"
                     "def sum_of_odds(n):\n"
                     "    return n * n\n"
                     "\n"
                     "# Calculate the sum of the first 10 odd numbers\n"
                     "sum_result = sum_of_odds(10)\n"
                     "\n"
                     "# Print the result\n"
                     "print(f'The sum of the first 10 odd numbers is: {sum_result}')"
     }
 }


You: You didn't actually write the file though

My apologies for that oversight. Let's proceed with writing the script to the file and then running it.

First, let's write the Python script to a file:


 {
     "tool": "write_file",
     "arguments": {
         "path": "C:/Users/charl/Downloads/odd_numbers_sum.py",
         "content": "# Define a function to calculate the sum of the first n odd numbers\n"
                     "def sum_of_odds(n):\n"
                     "    return n * n\n"
                     "\n"
                     "# Calculate the sum of the first 10 odd numbers\n"
                     "sum_result = sum_of_odds(10)\n"
                     "\n"
                     "# Print the result\n"
                     "print(f'The sum of the first 10 odd numbers is: {sum_result}')"
     }
 }


After writing the file, let's run it to see the output:


 {
     "tool": "run_shell",
     "arguments": {
         "command": "python C:/Users/charl/Downloads/odd_numbers_sum.py"
     }
 }

You: Theres still no file in the downloads folder - save it as a .md file

Animus
My apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's create an .md file instead of a Python script. Here is the content of the .md file:


 # Sum of the First 10 Odd Numbers

 The sum of the first 10 odd numbers can be calculated using the formula \( n^2 \), where \( n \) is the number of terms.

 For the first 10 odd numbers:
 - The sum is \( 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 10^2 = 100 \).

 So, the sum of the first 10 odd numbers is: **100**.


Now, let's write this .md file to C:\Users\charl\Downloads.


 {
     "tool": "write_file",
     "arguments": {
         "path": "C:/Users/charl/Downloads/odd_numbers_sum.md",
         "content": "# Sum of the First 10 Odd Numbers\n"
                     "\n"
                     "The sum of the first 10 odd numbers can be calculated using the formula \( n^2 \\), where \( n \\) is the number of terms.\n"
                     "\n"
                     "For the first 10 odd numbers:\n"
                     "- The sum is \( 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 = 10^2 = 100 \\).\n"
                     "\n"
                     "So, the sum of the first 10 odd numbers is: **100**."
     }
 }

You: but it wasn't written successfully, you did nothing

My apologies for the oversight. Let's proceed with writing the .md file and then running a command to ensure it was created.

                     "So, the sum of the first 10 odd numbers is: **100**."
     }
 }


After writing the file, let's confirm it was created by listing the directory contents.

     "arguments": {

END TEST

Notes on this run: the tool seems to be completely unable to execute scripts and even when it is explicity instructed to. They also don't opt to use the script tools even though I have instructed them and "animus instructions" has as well. We really need to fix this in order for this tool to have any usefulness at all. Animus needs to be able to follow instructions about what to do in the computer very closely. If we can hard code this solution we should because I'm tired of having to re-prompt the LLM to take any kind of action (and now it's failing totally at it). Also, the Animus logo is a bit messed up (the borders on the right side specifically).
