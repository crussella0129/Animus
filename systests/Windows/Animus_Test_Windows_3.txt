Prerequisites\n- A 2022 Subaru Outback\n- A computer running a custom Linux distro based on Debian\n- Necessary tools
and materials for flashing (e.g., flash drive, flashing software)\n\n## Steps to Flash the Center Console Computer\n1.
**Backup Data**: Before proceeding with any flashing process, ensure that all important data from the center console
computer is backed up.\n2. **Prepare the Flash Drive**: Create a bootable USB drive with the custom Linux distro based
on Debian using tools like `balenaEtcher` or `Rufus`.\n3. **Power Down and Disconnect**: Turn off your Subaru Outback
and disconnect any external devices to avoid data corruption during the flashing process.\n4. **Access the Center
Console Computer**: Follow the manufacturer's instructions to access the center console computer, which may involve
removing screws and accessing a hidden compartment.\n5. **Insert USB Drive**: Insert the bootable USB drive into the
center console computer.\n6. **Boot from USB**: Power up the center console computer and enter the boot menu to select
the USB drive as the boot device.\n7. **Start the Flashing Process**: Once booted, start the flashing process using the
provided software or instructions for your custom Linux distro. This may involve connecting to a network, downloading
updates, or performing other installation steps.\n8. **Reboot and Verify**: After the flashing process is complete,
reboot the center console computer and verify that it functions correctly with your custom Linux distro.\n\n##
Troubleshooting\n- If you encounter any issues during the flashing process, consult the manufacturer's documentation or
seek help from a Subaru service center.\n- Ensure that all steps are followed accurately to avoid damage to your Subaru
Outback and the center console computer."
